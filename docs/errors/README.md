Notes:
- In production, stack traces are suppressed and sensitive values in `context.value` are redacted.
- For CLI rendering, use `ErrorPresenter('dev'|'prod').formatForCLI(error)` and render the returned view.
- For API responses (RFC 7807 style), use `formatForAPI(error)`, which sets `type` to the documentation URL above.
