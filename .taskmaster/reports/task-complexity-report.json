		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Type System and Result Pattern",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the core type system implementation into atomic components: Result pattern implementation, type guards and utilities, branded types system, error hierarchy with proper inheritance, comprehensive test coverage, and integration with the rest of the codebase. Consider TypeScript advanced features like conditional types and mapped types for better developer experience.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to foundational nature affecting entire codebase. TypeScript Result pattern requires careful design for type safety and ergonomics. Error hierarchy needs robust architecture. Critical path dependency for all other tasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Build Schema Parser with JSON Schema Support",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide schema parsing into: JSON Schema specification analysis, parser interface design, basic type parsing (string, number, boolean), array parsing with item validation, nested object parsing with depth limit (â‰¤ 2) and property handling, constraint validation system, and comprehensive error reporting with schema path tracking. Handle edge cases like empty schemas and invalid JSON.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity as it needs to handle JSON Schema specification correctly. Must parse multiple schema types, handle constraints, and provide clear error messages. Foundation for data generation requiring robust implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create Format Registry System",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: registry pattern implementation with proper dependency injection, built-in format generators (UUID, email, date, date-time) with validation, custom format registration API, and comprehensive testing with format validation using existing libraries like validator.js.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity - registry pattern is well-established but needs careful design for extensibility. Format generators require domain knowledge but are mostly independent implementations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Data Generators",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: abstract generator base class design, string generator with length and format constraints, number generator with min/max/precision handling, integer generator with boundary validation, boolean generator, enum generator with caching, constraint validation system, property-based testing with fast-check, and performance optimization for batch generation.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to need for constraint compliance and performance. Each primitive type has specific edge cases. Property-based testing adds complexity but is essential for reliability. Integration with Faker.js while ensuring constraints."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Build Array and Object Generators",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: array generator with size constraints and item type validation, object generator with required/optional field handling, nested array support (arrays of primitives/objects), performance optimization for large datasets, and comprehensive testing with complex schema combinations.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to recursive nature and performance requirements. Array of objects introduces composition complexity. Must handle minItems/maxItems constraints correctly while maintaining performance for large datasets."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create Compliance Validator with AJV",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: AJV setup with strict mode and format validation, batch validation implementation for performance, detailed error reporting with schema paths, compliance scoring system, and performance testing with large datasets. Include error categorization and actionable error messages.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity - AJV is well-documented but configuration and error handling need careful design. Batch validation and performance requirements add complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Generation Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: pipeline orchestrator design with proper error propagation, seed-based deterministic generation, performance optimization and monitoring, and comprehensive integration testing across all components.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity - orchestration of multiple components with proper error handling. Deterministic generation requires careful seed management. Performance targets are ambitious."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Build CLI Commands with Commander.js",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: CLI structure setup with Commander.js, generate command implementation with all options, file I/O handling with proper error cases, user interface feedback with progress indicators, and comprehensive CLI testing including error scenarios and exit codes.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity - CLI is straightforward but needs proper error handling, file operations, and good UX. Testing CLI tools requires additional considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Error Handling and User Experience",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: error message enhancement with context and suggestions, workaround documentation for unsupported features, and user-friendly error formatting with actionable guidance.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity - primarily focused on improving existing error handling. Requires good UX design sense and clear technical communication."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Complete Test Suite and Performance Validation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: unit test completion with coverage analysis, integration test suite across all packages, performance benchmarking with automated validation, compliance testing with statistical analysis, test infrastructure and CI setup, and performance regression prevention.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to comprehensive testing requirements. Performance validation needs statistical rigor. Integration testing across monorepo packages adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Documentation and Examples",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: comprehensive README with quickstart guide, example schema collection with real-world use cases, API documentation with JSDoc and TypeDoc generation, and tutorial content for common scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "Low-medium complexity - documentation is time-consuming but straightforward. Examples need to be tested and maintained."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Launch Preparation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: GitHub repository setup with proper configuration, npm publication workflow with automated releases, demo and promotional material creation, launch communication preparation, and community engagement setup.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity - involves multiple external systems and coordination. Demo creation and launch materials require marketing consideration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 0,
			"taskTitle": "Project Setup and Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task with a focus on project setup and configuration.",
			"reasoning": "Automatically added due to missing analysis in AI response."
