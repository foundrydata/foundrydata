# Task ID: 29
# Title: Support Bounded Nested Object Parsing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Allow nested objects in JSONSchemaParser up to a configurable depth; beyond the limit, produce a clear ParseError with suggestions.
# Details:
ACCEPTANCE: nested objects parsed up to default depth=2; deeper structures fail fast with guidance. IMPLEMENTATION: recursive descent with depth counter; reuse existing type guards; keep MVP constraints documented. TESTS: AJV Ã— generator end-to-end for nested objects within bounds.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for depth boundary; integration tests ensuring generated nested objects validate; error-path tests with suggestion messages for over-depth schemas.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add depth limit to parser [done]
