# Task ID: 10
# Title: Configure CI/CD Pipeline for Testing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Phase 5 - Setup comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with multi-draft and multi-platform testing architecture v2.1
# Details:
**MATRIX TESTING CONFIGURATION:**
- Create .github/workflows/test.yml with testing v2.1 architecture
- Configure test matrix: draft-07 × 2019-09 × 2020-12 with SCHEMA_DRAFT environment variable
- Node.js versions: 18.x, 20.x, latest with proper npm cache configuration
- OS platforms: ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest with platform-specific pool tolerances
- Pool configuration: 'threads' for Windows, 'forks' for other platforms

**ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (Testing v2.1):**
- TEST_SEED=424242 for deterministic testing (NEVER Date.now())
- FC_NUM_RUNS: 100 (quick jobs), 1000 (full jobs), configurable per job type
- SCHEMA_DRAFT: draft-07|2019-09|2020-12 for multi-draft testing matrix
- DEBUG=false (CI), true (debug jobs) for logging control
- PERF_LOG=true for performance jobs with baseline comparison

**JOB TYPES ARCHITECTURE:**
- quick-tests: 5min timeout, FC_NUM_RUNS=100, core functionality validation
- full-tests: 30min timeout, FC_NUM_RUNS=1000, comprehensive matrix testing
- performance-tests: isolated job with baseline.json comparison and regression detection
- memory-tests: extended runs with leak detection and GC monitoring

**ARTIFACT MANAGEMENT & OPTIMIZATION:**
- Upload baseline.json for performance tracking and trend analysis
- Coverage reports with lcov format for external tools integration
- Test results with junit XML for GitHub annotations
- Performance reports with regression alerts (>20% degradation fails CI)
- Cache strategy: npm cache, compiled schemas, baseline artifacts
- Parallel job execution with proper dependency management
- Fail-fast: false for matrix jobs to collect all results
- Retry strategy: 0 retries (deterministic testing principle)

**STATUS REPORTING & QUALITY GATES:**
- GitHub status badges for README: test status, coverage, performance
- PR comments with performance regression alerts and artifact links
- All tests must pass with 100% compliance invariant
- Coverage threshold: 90% line coverage minimum
- Memory regression: >100MB increase fails CI
- ESLint: zero errors allowed with auto-fix in dedicated job

# Test Strategy:
Validate CI/CD configuration with test matrix execution across all draft × node × OS combinations. Verify deterministic behavior with fixed TEST_SEED=424242. Test artifact generation and baseline comparison functionality. Validate performance regression detection with intentional slowdowns. Test coverage reporting integration and quality gates enforcement.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create GitHub workflow file with testing v2.1 matrix configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement .github/workflows/test.yml with comprehensive matrix testing setup
### Details:
Create workflow file with:
- Matrix strategy: schema drafts (draft-07, 2019-09, 2020-12) × Node.js versions (18.x, 20.x, latest) × OS platforms (ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest)
- Platform-specific pool configuration: 'threads' for Windows, 'forks' for others
- Proper environment variable injection per matrix combination
- Cache configuration for npm and compiled schemas
- Parallel execution with dependency management

## 2. Configure environment variables and deterministic testing setup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Setup all required environment variables for testing v2.1 architecture
### Details:
Configure environment variables:
- TEST_SEED=424242 (fixed, never Date.now())
- FC_NUM_RUNS based on job type (100 for quick, 1000 for full)
- SCHEMA_DRAFT per matrix combination
- DEBUG=false for CI, true for debug jobs
- PERF_LOG=true for performance tracking
- Ensure deterministic behavior across all job types

## 3. Implement job type architecture with timeouts and configurations [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Setup different job types with specific configurations and timeouts
### Details:
Create job types:
- quick-tests: 5min timeout, FC_NUM_RUNS=100, core functionality
- full-tests: 30min timeout, FC_NUM_RUNS=1000, comprehensive matrix
- performance-tests: isolated job with baseline.json comparison
- memory-tests: extended runs with leak detection and GC monitoring
- Configure proper timeouts, retry policies (0 retries), and fail-fast settings

## 4. Setup artifact management and performance tracking [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure artifact upload/download and performance baseline tracking
### Details:
Implement artifact management:
- Upload baseline.json for performance tracking
- Coverage reports with lcov format
- Test results with junit XML for annotations
- Performance reports with trend analysis
- Regression detection with >20% degradation threshold
- Proper artifact retention and cleanup policies

## 5. Configure status reporting and quality gates [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Setup GitHub status badges, PR comments, and quality enforcement
### Details:
Implement reporting features:
- GitHub status badges for README (test status, coverage, performance)
- PR comments with performance regression alerts and artifact links
- Quality gates: 100% test compliance, 90% coverage minimum, memory regression limits
- ESLint zero-error policy with auto-fix job
- Integration with GitHub annotations for test results

## 6. Test and validate CI/CD pipeline functionality [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Comprehensive testing of the complete CI/CD pipeline setup
### Details:
Validate CI/CD functionality:
- Test matrix execution across all draft × node × OS combinations
- Verify deterministic behavior with TEST_SEED=424242
- Test artifact generation and baseline comparison
- Validate performance regression detection with intentional slowdowns
- Test coverage reporting and quality gate enforcement
- Verify status badge generation and PR comment functionality
