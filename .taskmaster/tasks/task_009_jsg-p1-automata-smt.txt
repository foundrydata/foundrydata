# Task ID: 9
# Title: Early-UNSAT diagnostics for objects
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Emit object-level UNSAT: empty coverage under presence pressure; required vs propertyNames; minProperties vs finite coverage.
# Details:
- Emit UNSAT_AP_FALSE_EMPTY_COVERAGE with proof summary.
- Emit UNSAT_REQUIRED_VS_PROPERTYNAMES.
- Emit UNSAT_MINPROPERTIES_VS_COVERAGE.

# Test Strategy:
Acceptance tests per spec scenarios.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement UNSAT_AP_FALSE_EMPTY_COVERAGE diagnostic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Detect and emit diagnostics when additionalProperties:false creates empty coverage under presence pressure from required properties or minProperties constraints.
### Details:
Add detection logic in composition-engine.ts to identify when AP:false combined with required properties results in impossible coverage. Emit UNSAT_AP_FALSE_EMPTY_COVERAGE diagnostic with proof summary including conflicting constraints and coverage analysis. Include provenance tracking for diagnostic context.

## 2. Implement UNSAT_REQUIRED_VS_PROPERTYNAMES diagnostic [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Detect conflicts between required properties and propertyNames constraints that make object generation impossible.
### Details:
Add logic to detect when required property names violate propertyNames constraints (enum, pattern, etc.). Emit UNSAT_REQUIRED_VS_PROPERTYNAMES diagnostic with detailed conflict analysis. Handle both literal and pattern-based propertyNames constraints with comprehensive proof generation.

## 3. Implement UNSAT_MINPROPERTIES_VS_COVERAGE diagnostic [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Detect when minProperties requirement exceeds available property coverage, making object generation impossible.
### Details:
Add detection for scenarios where minProperties value is greater than the finite set of allowed properties under coverage constraints. Emit UNSAT_MINPROPERTIES_VS_COVERAGE diagnostic with coverage analysis and property count calculations. Handle both finite and infinite coverage scenarios with appropriate proof summaries.
