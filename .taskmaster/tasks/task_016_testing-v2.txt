# Task ID: 16
# Title: Create Integration Tests
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Phase 4 - End-to-end integration testing with Testing Architecture v2.1 compliance
# Details:
- Create test/__tests__/integration/ directory for full pipeline tests
- Implement complete generation → validation pipeline tests with AJV oracle
- Test all schema drafts end-to-end: draft-07, 2019-09, 2020-12
- Cross-draft compatibility testing with FormatRegistry-AJV adapter
- Business scenario integration with real schemas from fixtures
- Error scenario testing with pipeline recovery and graceful degradation
- Load testing with cache behavior under realistic usage patterns
- Memory monitoring with leak detection for large datasets (10,000+ records)
- Verify determinism with fixed seed 424242 propagation through entire pipeline
- Performance end-to-end testing: full pipeline p95 < 20ms targets
- Cache warming integration with WeakMap validators and FormatRegistry caches
- Pipeline validation patterns: input/processing/output validation with error handling

# Test Strategy:
- Use custom matchers (toMatchJsonSchema, toBeDistinct) for full pipeline validation
- Implement performance benchmarking with percentile targets (p95)
- Apply deterministic testing with fixed seed 424242 for reproducible results
- Multi-platform testing to verify pipeline behavior across OS platforms
- Extended runs with full garbage collection monitoring for memory leak detection
- Logging standards: seed + schema + pipeline state on failures
- AJV oracle as single source of truth for 100% compliance verification

# Subtasks:

## 2. Implement full pipeline integration tests [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test complete generation → validation workflow with AJV oracle
### Details:
- Test schema parsing → generation → validation pipeline
- Integrate AJV oracle for 100% compliance verification

## 6. Implement deterministic integration testing [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify determinism and reproducibility across full pipeline
### Details:
- Test fixed seed 424242 propagation through entire pipeline
- Verify same seed produces identical results end-to-end
- Error reproduction testing with full context logging
- Performance consistency measurements with deterministic results

## 7. Create pipeline validation and error handling tests [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test validation patterns and error recovery mechanisms
### Details:
- Input validation: schema compliance and format validation
