# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Performance Benchmarks
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Phase 4 - Create comprehensive performance benchmarks with realistic targets following testing v2.1 architecture, including JSON Schema coverage metrics and cumulative regression detection
# Details:
- Create test/performance/benchmarks.test.ts with deterministic seed 424242
- Define benchmark levels with percentiles (NOT averages): simple (<0.5ms p95), medium (<2ms p95), complex (<20ms p95)
- Implement batch performance: p95 < 10ms for 1000 items validation
- Add memory efficiency: p95 < 100MB for 10,000 records generation
- Implement platform-aware tolerances: Windows * 1.5, macOS baseline, Linux baseline
- Add measurement methodology with warmup phases, outlier detection (remove top/bottom 5%)
- Implement cache warming for AJV validators and FormatRegistry before timing
- Add GC timing with forced garbage collection between test runs
- Generate baseline.json for performance tracking and regression detection
- Add automated alerts for >20% performance regression in CI
- Track JSON Schema coverage: keywords tested (type, format, constraints), keyword combinations coverage, edge cases per draft
- Implement cumulative regression test suite capturing failing cases as permanent tests
- Add AJV version compatibility performance testing

# Test Strategy:
Multiple runs with statistical analysis (min 100 runs for stable percentiles). Test across Node.js versions 18, 20, latest. Include micro benchmarks (single calls), integration benchmarks (full pipelines), and memory benchmarks (large datasets). Test performance across all JSON Schema drafts (draft-07, 2019-09, 2020-12). Implement memory leak detection over extended runs. Track JSON Schema keyword coverage and maintain cumulative regression suite.
