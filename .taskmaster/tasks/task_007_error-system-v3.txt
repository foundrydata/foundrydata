# Task ID: 7
# Title: Create Suggestion System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement pure functions for error suggestions, typo detection, and schema fix proposals
# Details:
Create packages/core/src/errors/suggestions.ts with pure functions:

didYouMean(input, validOptions[], maxDistance?):
- Simple edit distance algorithm for MVP
- Return top 3 suggestions within distance threshold
- No complex Levenshtein for v0.1 (performance)

getAlternative(unsupportedFeature):
- Return alternative from ALTERNATIVES_REGISTRY
- Map features to workarounds

proposeSchemaFix(error):
- Generate before/after schema examples
- Include diff visualization
- Add explanation text

getWorkaround(limitationKey):
- Retrieve workaround from limitations registry
- Include example and availableIn version

All functions must be pure (no side effects) for testability.

# Test Strategy:
Create packages/core/src/errors/__tests__/suggestions.test.ts:
- Test didYouMean with various typos
- Test distance calculation accuracy
- Test getAlternative registry lookups
- Test proposeSchemaFix generates valid diffs
- Test null returns for unknown inputs
- Property-based testing for didYouMean

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement didYouMean function [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create typo detection with simple distance algorithm
### Details:
In packages/core/src/errors/suggestions.ts:
- didYouMean(input, validOptions[], maxDistance = 3)
- Simple edit distance calculation (not Levenshtein for MVP)
- Return top 3 suggestions within threshold
- Sort by distance
Include calculateDistance helper function

## 2. Implement schema fix proposals [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create functions for alternative suggestions and schema corrections
### Details:
In packages/core/src/errors/suggestions.ts:
- getAlternative(unsupportedFeature): Lookup from ALTERNATIVES_REGISTRY
- proposeSchemaFix(error): Generate before/after with diff
- getWorkaround(limitationKey): Retrieve from limitations registry
All functions must be pure (no side effects)
