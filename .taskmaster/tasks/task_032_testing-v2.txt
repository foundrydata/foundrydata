# Task ID: 32
# Title: Measure AJV Cache Effectiveness (master:28)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Testing v2 - Measure and gate cache hit rate improvements from stable cache key strategy implemented in master task 28.
# Details:
ACCEPTANCE: (1) Semantically identical schemas (reordered keys) use the same compiled validator; (2) Cache hit rate improves vs baseline; (3) Compile count reduced under repeated validation workloads. REPORT: include hit/miss deltas and timing percentiles.

# Test Strategy:
Create reordered-schema fixtures and validate equality of cache key behavior; run micro-bench compile vs cached validate; record metrics and assert thresholds; integrate with performance baseline/regression suite.
