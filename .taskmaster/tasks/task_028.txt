# Task ID: 28
# Title: Stable Cache Key for AJV Compiled Validators
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Use a stable stringify or hashing strategy for schema cache keys to maximize cache hits and avoid recompilation due to key order.
# Details:
ACCEPTANCE: schemas with different key orders share the same cache entry; improved cache hit rate recorded. IMPLEMENTATION: canonical stringify (sorted keys) or fast hash; retain WeakMap for identity; guard heavy canonicalization. METRICS: before/after hit-rate and compile counts.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for key equality across orderings; measure hit/miss deltas in validator metrics; micro-bench compile vs cached validate.
