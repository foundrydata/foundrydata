[Key requirements]
- Provide mapCanonToOrig and reverse, plus toOriginalByWalk (longest-prefix walk).
[Deliverables]
- packages/core/src/util/ptr-map.ts
[Commands]
- pnpm i; pnpm -w build; pnpm -w test
[Definition of Done]
- Unit tests cover reverse-walk across nested paths; stable behavior.

# Test Strategy:
Unit: mapping inlining, longest-prefix reverse resolution; golden tests using tiny canonical vs original trees.

# Subtasks:
## 5001. Pointer maps and reverse walk [done]
